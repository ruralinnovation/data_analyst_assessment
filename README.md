# RISI Data Analyst Candidate Exercise
## Overview
The intention of this exercise is to assess your ability to think critically and apply your technical skill set to an analytics problem designed to reflect some of the tasks you are likely to encounter as a Data Analyst at RISI, albeit in a simplified manner. This exercise is deliberately vague and no specific approach or answer is “right”. 

### Instructions
Write a short, data-driven analysis of the data provided in this Github repository. The data originates from the [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) database and comprises information on suicides by age group, year group, and [American Communities Project (ACP)](https://www.americancommunities.org/) region typology.

### Required steps:
- Clone the Github repository.
- Clean and combine the provided data using R
- Write up a short analysis. Tell us an interesting story or stories from the data. Incorporate at least 2 data visualizations created with your preferred R data visualization package.

### Deliverable: 
- Any code and documentation required to reproduce your analysis and its results, including scripts, readmes, diagrams, or other instructive material provided via a link to a Github repository.
- Analysis document and visualizations as described above.

## Guidelines
We should be able to re-run your analysis and duplicate your results with whatever code and documentation you provide and nothing else. Overly documented code is something we never complain about! For the data visualization component of this exercise, polish and aesthetics are important. 

With that said, this task will take some time. If you need more time or cannot complete all components of the exercise please contact us and we can make accommodations; certain skills may be more important to demonstrate than others based on experience.

### Dos
1. Do ask questions 
2. Do use code efficiently and comment clearly
3. Do review your work and minimize the occurrence of errors
4. Do include checks and data diagnostics within your code.
5. Do use scripts whenever possible

### Don’ts
1.  Don’t use spreadsheets in this exercise; doing tabulations in a spreadsheet is fine but no part of your analysis should rely on them.
2.  Don’t rely heavily, if at all, on GUI commands or instructions. We want to see how you program, not how well you use a particular software package. 
3.  Don’t assume we know what you’re doing; document it.
4.  Don’t be afraid to think outside the box. You are encouraged to augment your analysis with something that demonstrates your unique toolkit but it must clearly provide value or insight
