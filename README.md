# RISI Data Analyst Assessment


## Process

- Clone this repository
- Clean and combine data
- Write up a short analysis (roughly 1 page). Tell us an interesting story or stories from the data.
- Create 2 or more data visualizations to accompany the analysis. Strong preference for visualizations created with R.
- Commit your code, analysis, and visualizations to your clone of this repository
- Send a link to your finished work to matt.rogers@ruralinnovation.us by DATE. __Ensure your clone of the repository is public so we can see it!__

## Expectations

- Repository should contain final versions of all code used to clean, combine, and visualize the data
- We should be able to run all of your code for ourselves. Beware of using paths in your scripts like `C/Users/me/path/only/I/have`.
